# Neural Network Example - Educational Use Only

## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of a neural network using the NumPy library. The network includes basic functions for forward propagation, backpropagation, saving, and loading model weights. It's designed as a straightforward example to help understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks and their training processes.

## Educational Purpose

The primary goal of this script is educational. It aims to provide students, educators, and hobbyists with a clear example of how a neural network can be implemented and trained to perform basic tasks, in this case, a simple XOR operation. The script showcases the implementation of the sigmoid activation function, its derivative, and a basic structure of a neural network including weight initialization, feedforward, and backpropagation.

## Limitations for Real-World Applications

While this script serves as a solid foundation for understanding neural networks, it has several limitations that restrict its utility in real-world applications:

1. **Scalability**: The network is designed with a fixed architecture (two layers with hardcoded neuron counts) and may not scale well with more complex problems or larger datasets.
2. **Performance**: The script lacks optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as regularization, advanced optimization algorithms, and batch processing, which can significantly impact training speed and model performance.
3. **Generalization**: Without mechanisms like validation checks or dropout, the model might not generalize well to unseen data, potentially leading to overfitting.
4. **Efficiency**: The script is not optimized for computational efficiency. Real-world applications often require the use of specialized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch that can leverage hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs).

## Usage

This script is intended to be run as-is for educational purposes. Users are encouraged to experiment with modifying the code to better understand the impact of different neural network components and parameters. However, any alterations for the purpose of deploying in a real-world application should be approached with caution, considering the aforementioned limitations.

## Conclusion

This neural network example is a valuable educational tool for those looking to understand the basics of neural networks and their training processes. However, it is not suited for professional or production environments. For more advanced applications, one should consider using more sophisticated and optimized deep learning frameworks and architectures.
